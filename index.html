            <p>Today, my famil and I have just retruned home form LA, and I have to say that driving
                is really tiring. But <br>all of this has passed. We bought lots of fun things from LA,
                the most interesting of which is a <br><b>Chinese puzzle lock</b>. This is a lock tha can only
                be unlocked in one posture. It took me nearly an hour to unlock it,<br> and this is only
                the most basic. I like this kind of stuff very much, and I hope I can buy more
                difficult ones when i go to LA again.
